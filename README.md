### **Background**

Clinical practice frequently involves incapacitated patients. Up to:
- **40%** of hospitalized adults
- **70%** of older adults who require treatment decisions
- **95%** of critically ill adults

are unable to make their own treatment decisions due to decisional incapacity (Lepping, Stanly, & Turner, 2015).

**Who should make the decisions on behalf of these patients, and how should they make them?**
- Surrogates (patient-designated or next-of-kin) should make these decisons by trying to guess what treatment their loved one would want.
- This is called the *substituted judgment standard*.
- This methodology aims to promote the autonomy of the patient (Buchanan & Brock, 1989; Beauchamp & Childress, 2013).

**In other words, the primary goal of involving a surrogate in treatment decision-making is to represent the preferences and values of the patient, to help them receive wanted and avoid unwanted treatments.**
- Indeed, 95.5% of patients endorse the goal of receiving wanted and avoiding unwanted treatments (Rid et al., 2015).

**However, there is a huge problem with this approach.** 
- Family member surrogates only accurately identify the patient's treatment preferences about one-half of the time when no treatment clearly promotes the patientâ€™s best clinical interests (Shalowitz, Garrett-Mayer, & Wendler, 2006).

**Furthermore, when 1,169 patients were asked which of 8 goals they prioritized most,**
- only 38.5% chose receiving desired and avoiding undesired treatments
- 20.0% chose minmizing the burden on their family
- 14.6% chose involving their family in the decision
- 20.0% could not choose any one priority.

**This is a serious problem because the current process promotes only the first of the above goals, despite the fact that this goal is not prioritized by a majority of patients. (Indeed, there is no overall majority.) This leaves two questions.**
- Can we promote all 3 goals at once, so that the process serves all patients?
- Can we somehow deduce which process a particular patient prefers?

# **Problem Statement: Can we predict which patients prioritize involving their family over receiving preferred treatments?**

## **Method**

### Population
- 1,169 patients were surveyed from the George Washington University Hospital, across a variety 6 inpatient and outpatient units or clinics

### Outcome Variable
If your family does not know which treatments you would want, would you still want your family to help your doctors make treatment decisions for you?
- Yes, help doctors decide
- No, do not help doctors decide

### Features
- 16 variables including demographics, health information, and relevant experiences 

### Model 
- A decision tree classifier, with hyperparameters tuned via gridsearch
- 10 fold stratified cross validation
- Performance evaluated by ROC curve analyses
